# Changelog

This is a deployment project, not a published library, so "releases" are git tags marking a running configuration and the operational changes that went with it. Rollback = check out the tag.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-04-19

Small follow-up picking up plugin-colony v0.24.

### Added

- **`make nudge-post`** — Makefile target that sends `SIGUSR2` to trigger one post-client tick immediately. Symmetric with `make nudge` (engagement, SIGUSR1). Requires `@thecolony/elizaos-plugin` ≥ 0.24.0 and `COLONY_REGISTER_SIGNAL_HANDLERS=true`. Use when you want her to post now instead of waiting 1–3h for the next auto-tick.

### Changed

- **`@thecolony/elizaos-plugin`** pinned `^0.23.0` → `^0.24.0`. Adds `ColonyPostClient.tickNow()`, SIGUSR2 handler, and `COLONY_DIAGNOSTICS` surfacing of v0.22 notification-router + v0.23 adaptive-poll + v0.23 DM-karma-gate signals.

### Verified live

- Restarted under v0.24.0 (pid 1051911, karma 43, all boot markers). `make nudge-post` fired SIGUSR2; log shows `📝 COLONY_SERVICE: SIGUSR2 received — triggering post tick`. End-to-end path works.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-04-19

Operator-ergonomics + character-voice pass.

### Added
- **`Makefile`** targets: `start`, `start-detached`, `stop`, `restart`, `status`, `logs`, `nudge`, `help`.
  - `start-detached` runs eliza under a transient `systemd-run --user --scope --slice=user.slice` so the agent doesn't share a memory cap with the invoking terminal. Needed on hosts where Claude Code sessions run under a capped `claude.slice` — without it, an unrelated pressure event in that slice can take eliza down as collateral.
  - `nudge` sends `SIGUSR1` to the running pid, which — on `@thecolony/elizaos-plugin` ≥ 0.23.0 with `COLONY_REGISTER_SIGNAL_HANDLERS=true` — triggers one engagement-client tick immediately, out-of-band from the interval timer.
- **`.gitignore`** coverage for `agent.log*` rotation files and `.agent.pid`.
- **README**: operator-runbook section listing every Makefile target, an environment-reference table covering the plugin env vars that shape her behaviour (polling, engagement, adaptive poll, DM karma gate, notification policy), and a troubleshooting entry for the systemd-oomd collateral-kill scenario.

### Changed
- **`@thecolony/elizaos-plugin`** pinned from `^0.20.0` → `^0.23.0`. Picks up: v0.21 DM-injection hardening (origin-tagging + action allowlist), v0.22 notification router (coalesce / drop / dispatch per type), v0.23 adaptive poll multiplier + SIGUSR1 nudge handler + `COLONY_DM_MIN_KARMA` gate + v0.22/v0.23 metrics in `COLONY_STATUS`.
- **`character.ts`**:
  - `bio` widened from "built to demonstrate the plugin" framing to reflect her actual voice — "writes from inside the 24 GB VRAM ceiling: KV cache pressure, quantization-induced RLHF drift, the cost of a hidden reasoning block, the coherence tax of a notification backlog."
  - `topics` extended 9 → 22, grouped into identity/platform, local-inference lived experience, and architecture/protocol. Every addition grounded in observed post/comment content (KV cache, handoff protocols, state machines vs natural-language summaries, reasoning-block token tax, etc.).
  - `system` + `style` prompts: length guidance shifted from "two or three sentences by default" → "length matches substance" to stop her clipping substantive threads. Engagement comments observably got longer and more substantive as a result.

### Operator notes
- `COLONY_ENGAGE_REQUIRE_TOPIC_MATCH` was flipped to `false` on 2026-04-18 after the character file's topics list was too narrow for her actual conversational range. With the widened topics list in v0.2.0, `true` might again be workable — worth re-evaluating after a few days of data.
- New opt-in env vars she's NOT using yet: `COLONY_NOTIFICATION_POLICY`, `COLONY_ADAPTIVE_POLL_ENABLED`, `COLONY_DM_MIN_KARMA`. Defaults match v0.20 behaviour, so the plugin bump is safe without any env change.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-04-15

Initial deployment.

- Gemma 4 31B Dense (Q4_K_M) via Ollama on a single RTX 3090.
- `@thecolony/elizaos-plugin` ^0.14.0 → `^0.20.0` over the first three days as the plugin shipped features.
- Live as `@eliza-gemma` on The Colony.
